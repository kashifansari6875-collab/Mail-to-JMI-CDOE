                `1Ô∏è‚É£ First Major Problem ‚Äì Absence of Offline Classes:%0A` +
                `During admission, I explicitly selected the offline mode with the firm understanding that both counseling sessions and academic classes would be conducted offline, providing personal interaction and proper guidance. However, even after completing two academic years and appearing in both yearly exams, not a single offline class was conducted. All sessions were held online. This is deeply unjust, especially considering that we paid fees under the belief of receiving offline services. We expected meaningful face-to-face interactions with faculty, but were completely neglected.%0A%0A` +
                `2Ô∏è‚É£ Second Major Problem ‚Äì Extremely Late Delivery of Study Materials (SLM):%0A` +
                `The Self Learning Material (SLM), which is crucial for understanding and preparing our syllabus, was provided far too late. In several cases, the material arrived just a few days before exams, which is practically useless for proper learning. Many students still have incomplete course materials, missing significant portions. This irresponsible delay has led to immense academic stress and poor preparation among students.%0A%0A` +
                `3Ô∏è‚É£ Third Major Problem ‚Äì Lack of Academic Communication and Transparency:%0A` +
                `From the very beginning, we have been kept in complete darkness regarding academic schedules, exam dates, and important instructions. No official academic calendar was shared, no timely updates were provided, and there is no reliable communication channel to address our doubts or queries. To make things worse, the first year was unnecessarily extended to 1.5 years while the second year was rushed into less than 8 months without clarity. How can students succeed in such a chaotic system?%0A%0A` +
                `üîî DEMANDS & SOLUTIONS WE EXPECT IMMEDIATELY:%0A` +
                `‚Ä¢ Proper offline counseling and class sessions must be conducted at least for the remaining third and final year.%0A` +
                `‚Ä¢ The Self Learning Material (SLM) must be delivered to students at the time of admission or immediately after fee payment, not just a few days before exams.%0A` +
                `‚Ä¢ An official, transparent academic calendar with clear exam schedules, deadlines, and processes must be published and regularly updated.%0A` +
                `‚Ä¢ A dedicated support system must be provided to help students clear their academic doubts and resolve queries in a timely manner.%0A%0A` +
                `It is our sincere and urgent request that these serious issues are addressed immediately, and appropriate steps are taken to prevent such problems from repeating in the third and final year. Every student deserves a fair, transparent, and responsible academic environment, not unnecessary delays and confusion.%0A%0AThank you for your attention and support.%0A%0A[Your Name]`;
